# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis
### Requirments
Build a visual data storey or dashboard using power BI to present to stakeholders

### Data analysis project pipeline
   1) Build a database
   2) Develope SQL query 
   3) Connect power BI to the database
   4) Visualize
   5) Summariz findings
   
### 1) Database Building
For this particular we are having three years of separate data(2018,2019,2020) which is a kind of hotel booking data.
Also we are provided with two separate data which are Market Segment data and Meal Cost data.
In order to visualize these data in power BI we need to make union of 2018,2019,and 2020 data.
And also we need to concatenate market segment data and meal cost data with the data we obtained from union operation.

### 2) Develope SQL query
For building database for addressing this problem we use Microsoft SQL server managment studio(MSSMS)
Snipp of MSSMS is shown below

### 3) Connect MSSMS to Power BI 
Power BI provides wide variety of data sources one of which is sql server.<br>
one can easily get data from sql server into power bi.<br>
Power BI also has option of quering the data into power bi itself through structured query language.<br>
In this project i write sql query within the power BI and power bi load the data as per our query requirments.<br>


### 4) Visualisation
Power BI is one of the strongest Bi tool in the market today.<br>
In this project power bi is used for visualisation.<br>
Snapshot of Power BI dashboard is shown below.<br>
