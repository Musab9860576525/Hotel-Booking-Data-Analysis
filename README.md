### 1) Database Building
For this particular we are having three years of separate data(2018,2019,2020) which is a kind of hotel booking data.
Also we are provided with two separate data which are Market Segment data and Meal Cost data.
In order to visualize these data in power BI we need to make union of 2018,2019,and 2020 data.
And also we need to concatenate market segment data and meal cost data with the data we obtained from union operation.

### 2) Develope SQL query
For building database for addressing this problem we use Microsoft SQL server managment studio(MSSMS)
Snipp of MSSMS is shown below
